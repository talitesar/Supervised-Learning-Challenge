# Supervised-Learning-Challenge

This repository contains my submission for the UTA Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp supervised learning challenge. It contains the creating of a logistic regression model to classify loans as "healthy" or "high-risk" using various information about the borrower. The analysis also includes a comparasion of a logistic regression model fit to the original data and a model fit to oversampled data.
